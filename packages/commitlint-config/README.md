# @abinnovision/commitlint-config

[Commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/#/) config for all types of projects. The
config mostly inherits the
[Conventional config](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/%40commitlint/config-conventional).
There are just some increased limits to make them work with
the tooling of AB innovision.

## Installation

```shell
yarn add --dev \
	# This config itself.
	@abinnovision/commitlint-config \
	# Commitlint itself.
	@commitlint/cli
```
